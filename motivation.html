            I know being away from your family and friends can be tough, and itâ€™s okay to feel a little low sometimes. 
            But remember, this is just a new chapter in your journeyâ€”one that will make you even stronger. 
            You are more than enough, and youâ€™re never alone.
            Your family and friends are just a call away, and Iâ€™m always here for you. 
            Whenever you feel down, please reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear your voice! ðŸ’–
            You are strong, talented, and unstoppable! Your hard work and passion in architecture will lead you to amazing success. 
            Keep going, because youâ€™ve got this! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
